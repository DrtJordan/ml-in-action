## Run

There are three train scripts about the train model. 

* python3 train.py
* python3 train_alex.py
* python3 train_vgg.py

## Test

## Model Downloading

I train three models with different architectures: one is with three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers; another is with five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers like AlexNet; the last one is with 13 convolutional layers and three fully connected layers like VGG-16.
